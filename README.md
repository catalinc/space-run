# Space Run

A space shooter game. Built on top of [Star Explorer][1] sample by [Corona SDK][2].

The game is far from finished. This is only prototype that I built for fun.

# Controls

Drag ship to move. The ship is firing continously while dragged.

# Credits

Graphics and sounds are taken from [Star Explorer][1] tutorial.
